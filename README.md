A game in Bevy inspired by one of my favourite childhood game: [Funny Bunny](https://www.ravensburger.co.uk/en-GB/products/games/children-games/funny-bunny-21558).

## How to use

(Faster to test it on desktop.)

```bash
just desktop
```

You can also compile it to wasm:
  
```bash
just web
```

More information: [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#wasm).

## Todo (not very developed sry)

- [ ] Game logic
- [ ] Assets/models
- [ ] Server
- [ ] Discord activity?
